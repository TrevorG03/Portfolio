                        <h3>Traveling</h3>
                        <p>I love to travel, I had a dream to go to europe backpacing when i was 8 and at 18 I had saved for 10 years as much as i could, I ended up having 8 thousand to spend. I went Alone and it was very scary at first but after meeting nice people in the hostel in madrid I was eager to continue. Since I came back to europe, I now decided I would love to walk from one coast to the other at some point in my life and to try to vist all 50 states and all of the wonders of the world. I have been to 12 states currently and my favorite city so far is definatly Chicago or London. They are 2 similar but also very different cities and both are beautiful in their own ways.</p>

My favorite SAGA is probably the Cell Saga. I am currently on and off enjoying one piece as well as chainsaw man which recently premired.</p>
